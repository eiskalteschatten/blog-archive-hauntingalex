  "excerpt": "Earlier this week, April 3rd, Static-X&#8217;s new album, Cannibal, was released. It didn&#8217;t take long before I bought it from the iTunes Music Store. The style of the album is new and you might even say heavier, but still very typically Static-X. I would definitely recommend it to any Static-X fan or anyone who just &#8230; more &#x2192;\n",
