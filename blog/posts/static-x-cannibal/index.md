Earlier this week, April 3rd, Static-X’s new album, **Cannibal**, was released. It didn’t take long before I bought it from the iTunes Music Store.

The style of the album is new and you might even say heavier, but still very typically Static-X. I would definitely recommend it to any Static-X fan or anyone who just likes good metal.
