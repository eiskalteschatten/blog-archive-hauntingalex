  "excerpt": "Mozilla officially released Firefox 10 today. I&#8217;ve just downloaded it on both Windows and for Mac OS X and am playing around with it a bit. Visually it looks much like Firefox 9 with the exception of the back/forward button. The back button is now &#8216;attached&#8217; to the address bar and the forward button is &#8230; more &#x2192;\n",
