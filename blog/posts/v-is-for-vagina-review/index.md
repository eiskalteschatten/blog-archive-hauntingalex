For those of you who don’t know already, Puscifer’s album, *V Is for Vagina*, was released at Midnight, October 30. It took a while longer for the album to show up in the iTunes Music Store, but I was eventually able to download it. After very patiently waiting for the downloads to finish, I listened through the entire album. Then I listened through the entire album again.

The album is very good. It’s unlike anything you’ve heard from Maynard before. If you don’t know who Maynard is, he’s Tool’s front man. *V Is for Vagina* sounds absolutely nothing like Tool or like A Perfect Circle. The music for the most part is quite industrial sounding; and, as I said in my last post about Puscifer, it bears somewhat of a resemblance to the Gorillaz. The similarities are, however, quite limited. It is much more industrial and quite a bit darker overall than anything by the Gorillaz. Maynard’s vocals are also quite a bit more powerful.

The album has a variety of sounds as the songs were made in coordination with various other musicians. All of them do, however, have a consistent enough sound that they sound like they should be on one album together.

The major complaint I would have is that most of the tracks have an obvious ‘white noise’ in the background, which is usually a sign of poor recording quality. It seems surprising to me that anything done by Maynard would have poor recording quality, but the white noise is undeniably there.

Other than that, the album is worth every single cent you spend on it. In fact, I think I’m going to listen to it again now.
