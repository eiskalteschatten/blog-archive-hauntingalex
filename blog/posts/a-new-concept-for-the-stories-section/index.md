I have decided to completely reconceptualize the [Stories section](https://haunting.alexseifert.com/stories/) of Haunting Alex. Originally, my intention was to repost ghost stories, vampire stories and other types of horror stories that I have enjoyed reading over the years and are old enough to be in the public domain. I am particularly fond of horror stories from the nineteenth century.

However, that turned out to be way to much work for the limited amount of free time that I have. Therefore, I have decided to turn it into a section for books and stories that I have enjoyed over the years, but without reposting the entire story. This also allows me to also post modern novels where I can just include the description from Amazon or GoodReads. As such, you will notice that it now features cover images and is therefore much more colorful.

Another new feature is the ability to link posts to stories. Several of my posts are about stories I wish to include in that section and linking them allows me to display the linked stories at the bottom of posts as well as the linked posts on the story pages.

An example for that is *Stirrings in The Black House* by Ambrose Ibsen. You can find the new story page [here](https://haunting.alexseifert.com/stories/stirrings-in-the-black-house/) and the post I wrote about it [here](https://haunting.alexseifert.com/2024/10/14/stirrings-in-the-black-house-by-ambrose-ibsen/).

I have also added links to where you can buy the books or read them online if they are in the public domain. Another new feature you will find is a rating I have given each story.

As of now, there are only three stories that I chose to start with because they correlate with posts I have already written (see the example above).

I hope you’ll find the new [Stories section](https://haunting.alexseifert.com/stories/) useful or at least interesting. In a way, it’s going to serve as a bit of a public book journal for my favorite horror books. New stories will also appear in the [RSS feed](https://haunting.alexseifert.com/feed) if you have subscribed to that.
