I’m happy to announce that the [stories section](https://blog.alexseifert.com/stories/) with the first public-domain stories is finally online and available! I have copied several horror stories that I have read and enjoyed in the past from [The Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). The plan is to create an archive of horror stories that primarily focus on ghosts and vampires as those are my favorite subgenres.

You can find the stories in the [stories section](https://blog.alexseifert.com/stories/).

The design will probably still change as it’s currently only a list of stories sorted by when I added them which isn’t ideal for finding stories. I think a list divided up alphabetically by title would be best.

If you have any suggestions for stories available in the public domain, feel free to [contact me](https://blog.alexseifert.com/contact/)!
