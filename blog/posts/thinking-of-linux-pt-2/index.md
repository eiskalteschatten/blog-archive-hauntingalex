\[digg=http://digg.com/linux\_unix/Thinking\_of\_Linux\_Pt\_2\]First of all, I would like to thank everyone who gave me feedback and suggestions on my [last post concerning moving to Linux](http://alexseifert.wordpress.com/2007/11/03/thinking-of-linux/).

Since then, I’ve done quite a bit of research and looking around at various manufacturers, prices, configurations and options available out there. After quite a bit of research, I think I’ve come to the same conclusion that most people seem to come to: I’ll partition the hard drive and install Linux on one partition and Windows on the other. I really don’t want Windows Vista as that’s nothing but bloatware, so I will probably install Windows XP Pro. That seems like the best option as then I can run [Reason](http://www.propellerheads.se) as well as other various programs that might not have a Linux equivalent.

The other option I was considering was using [Wine](http://www.winehq.org), but I’m a little weary about using something like that though. I will probably try it as well as partitioning my hard drive, but I don’t really want to just have to rely on it. If you’ve used it before, let me know. I would like to know how well it actually runs applications that demand quite a bit of a computer’s resources (such as Reason).

I think the only thing that remains now is to find a manufacturer and the best bang for my buck.
