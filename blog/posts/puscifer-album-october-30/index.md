I’m sure not many people here have ever heard of Puscifer. I aim to change that. Puscifer (pronouned: pussy-fur) is a new side project of Tool’s front man, Maynard James Keenan. Maybe you have heard a couple of songs without realizing it. The only two songs officially released from the project on an album are Rev 22:20 and The Undertaker. They were quietly released on the soundtracks to the movies *Underworld* and *Underworld 2*. On top of Rev 22:20 and The Undertaker, Puscifer recently gave us a preview of the upcoming album through a third song called Queen B. Oh, and let’s not forget the song entitled My Cuntry Boner.

The general sound from the four songs released so far sounds nothing like Tool or A Perfect Circle. A better comparison might be a gothic version of the Gorillaz on crack with Maynard’s vocals. It’s also pretty industrial, except for My Cuntry Boner which has the sound of an old country song.

What I find most unique about this project is that Maynard is going it alone. Puscifer is not signed to a label and Maynard intends to keep it that way. As he claims, he is experimenting to see how far he can take the project without a label-backing. As I am also an independent musician, I really hope he is able to make headway and maybe even break the trend.

Puscifer’s first EP, Don’t Shoot the Messenger, is already available for purchase [here](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=oiyVbGokg9Q&offerid=78941&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fphobos.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewAlbum%253Fi%253D265127827%2526id%253D265127810%2526s%253D143441%2526partnerId%253D30) and the first album from the project, entitled V for Vagina, will be available on October 30, 2007.
