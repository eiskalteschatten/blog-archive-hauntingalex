I’m not sure what to call Emigrate. Is it German rock? or is it American?

I say this because, although Emigrate was recently founded by Rammstein’s lead guitarist, Richard Z Kruspe, it was founded in America. The other members are also American. The vocals are in English, but they’re managed by Pilgrim Management (the same management firm as Rammstein) and they’re signed to a German label. I suppose I’ll let you decide for yourself which it really is.

Either way, there is one thing that I DO know about Emigrate: they kick ass. The band was founded in 2005 as side project of Rammstein’s lead guitarist, Richard Z Kruspe. Rammstein has been taking an extended break from touring and recording since the release of their album “Rosenrot”, but Richard decided to continue making music.

With the release of Reise, Reise, then followed closely by Rosenrot, there was a significant change in Rammstein’s style. Richard had several more ideas for songs, however, his ideas no longer fit Rammstein’s new style. Therefore, Emigrate was born.

Based out of New York City, where Richard now lives, the band has recorded at least four songs (*My World*, *Temptation*, *Wake Up*, and *Babe*) and released two to the public as free downloads. If you would like to download the songs, *Babe* and *Wake Up*, all you have to do is visit their website, [http://www.pilgrim-management.de/Emigrate](http://www.pilgrim-management.de/Emigrate), and sign up for the newsletter. A link to the downloads will be sent to you via e-mail.

The band currently consists of Arnaud Giroux from Axel Bauer (bass), Henka Johansson from Clawfinger (drums) and of course Richard, who not only plays the guitar, but also sings. His lyrics are in English, although occasionally you can hear a German accent if you listen hard enough.
