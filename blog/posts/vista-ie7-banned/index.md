\[digg=http://www.digg.com/microsoft/Vista\_IE7\_Banned\]This is interesting:

The U.S. Department of Transportation has banned any upgrades to Microsoft Windows Vista, Internet Explorer 7, and even Office 2007. The DOT’s CIO, Daniel Mintz, says he has placed “an indefinite moratorium” on the upgrades. In the memo he wrote to his staff, he stated the reason as being that “there appears to be no compelling technical or business case for upgrading to these new Microsoft software products. Furthermore, there appears to be specific reasons not to upgrade.” The ban applies to about 15,000 computers.

In the same memo, a ban on upgrading to the same products is also in effect at the Federal Aviation Administration. This ban applies to about 45,000 computers.

In an interview given on Friday, March 2, the chief technology officer at DOT, Tim Schmidt, said, “We’re analyzing different client software options and also integration issues.” He also mentioned possible alternatives to Windows Vista being Novell’s Suse Linux and Apple’s Macintosh computers.

I read about this in an article on [http://www.informationweek.com](http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197700789).

I also found this to be quite funny. According to the article, this could affect several million dollars of software sales of Microsoft software; especially if other federal organizations follow suite. Hopefully this will be a wake up call for Microsoft. While Vista might sport some cool features, Microsoft really didn’t appear to do much to it to motivate corporations (or in this case federal entities) to upgrade to Vista.

We’ll see how this turns out I suppose. What’s your opinion of it?
