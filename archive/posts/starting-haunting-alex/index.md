Ever since I was a young child, I’ve been fascinated with tales of ghosts, vampires and all sorts of other horror subgenres. In fact, it’s rare that I read any fiction that isn’t a horror story of one kind or another which is why I’ve decided to start this blog.

This is where I am planning on sharing my thoughts on what I read and what I think stands out about outstanding stories.

Most of the horror I read involves ghosts and vampires with many of those stories dating back to the nineteenth century when ghost stories were particularly popular and vampire fiction was just starting to gain traction. As such, I also intend to create an archive of some of my favorite short horror stories that are in the public domain.

Of course, any feedback or comments you might have about any of what I write would be greatly appreciated.

Also, if you have any tips for good horror fiction, do let me know. I’m always open to suggestions!

Thank you for visiting and I hope you have a spookily good time!
